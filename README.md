Rapid Access Data Manager

This project is created as a development tool, where data can be rapidly pushed onto a server, storing data in a JS object. 
Database access is optional, as snapshotting is possible. Snapshotting will store the data array onto a database. Recovering is done by saving the UUID of the snapshot or looking into the adminoverview at /adminoverview
